    "I chose Simmulated Annealing as a stochastic optimiser for Task 3 \n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2 Why did you choose this optimiser?\n",
    "\n",
    "The spring relies on multiple variables making the graphical image of what the data might look like very complex, this means \n",
    "we cannot just choose a simple algorithm to optimise the problem and a stochastic approach would be beneficial.\n",
    "Simulated annealing allows distortion to be added to the data set to avoid getting stuck at a local minima,\n",
    "this normally allows a good optimal to be found. Simulated annealing works better with continuous function approximation \n",
    "than GA algorithms. As f(x) is a continuous function this makes simulated annealing the better option that should be implemented\n",
    "to solve this problem. [99 words]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3 What constraint handling method(s) are you using and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle the inequality constraints of g1 to g4 and to keep all the simulated annealing points within the feasible space I\n",
    "have used death penalties. Any combinations of values (x1, x2, x3) that do not pass g1 to g4 are rejected as these would \n",
    "produce an f(x) outside of the feasible region and take up more computational power than necessary.\n"
